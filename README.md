# PlantSense - Smart Plant Care Dashboard

## What is this project?

**PlantSense** is a smart plant monitoring and automation system. It allows users to monitor real-time plant data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity), control a water pump, set thresholds, and receive notificationsâ€”all through a modern, responsive web dashboard. The system is designed to help plant owners keep their plants healthy with minimal effort.

## What I Did

### Frontend Development

- **Designed and built a responsive dashboard** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Implemented real-time data visualization** with Chart.js and Gauge.js for sensor data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity).
- **Created interactive UI components**:
  - Plant selection dropdown with search and auto-threshold population.
  - Threshold sliders and input fields for moisture, temperature, and humidity.
  - Manual/auto mode toggle for pump control.
  - Notification settings with email integration.
- **Integrated Firebase Realtime Database** for live sensor data, control commands, and settings.
- **Added alert and notification system**:
  - Email notifications using EmailJS.
  - Visual and audio alerts for critical plant conditions.
- **Built a Plant Care Guide page** with care tips and benefits, styled for readability and engagement.
- **Ensured mobile responsiveness** and accessibility across devices.
- **Used modern CSS techniques** (CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties) for layout and theming.
- **Focused on clean, maintainable code** and user-friendly design.

### Why this is helpful for my frontend engineer journey

- **Real-world dashboard experience**: Built a full-featured, interactive dashboard from scratch.
- **Data-driven UI**: Learned to handle real-time data updates and state management in the browser.
- **API and service integration**: Connected frontend to Firebase and third-party services (EmailJS).
- **UI/UX best practices**: Practiced designing for usability, clarity, and responsiveness.
- **Component-based thinking**: Broke down UI into reusable, manageable pieces.
- **Problem-solving**: Handled async data, error states, and user feedback.
- **Portfolio-ready**: Demonstrates ability to deliver a complete, polished frontend project.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` for the landing page.
2. Use `dashboard.html` for the main plant monitoring dashboard.
3. Explore `recommendations.html` for plant care tips and guides.
4. The dashboard connects to Firebase for live data (requires backend/Arduino setup for full functionality).
